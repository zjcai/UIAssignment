                <h2>Assignment Overview</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="panel-body">
                <p>
                    In this assignment, you will create a photo rating web application called
                    <em>Fotag</em>, which allows users to display a set of images using
                    different views. Users can rate each image, and filter images based on their
                    ratings. The images will be "loaded" from the file system, and chosen using HTML5's new
                    file chooser capabilities. The images chosen, and the ratings, will be stored locally
                    using <code><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_webstorage.asp">localStorage</a></code>. We have provided you with code that deals with storing and retrieving
                    image collections.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>
                        You are not allowed to use any third-party JavaScript or CSS files in this assignment with the following exceptions: </em>
                        <ul>
                        <li>
                        Mocha, Chai, Sinon, etc. that are included for unit testing.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        Underscore.js is included and may be used.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        You may use CSS preprocessors BUT we will not run the compiler for you. We will grade what are checked in, so make sure to compile before submitting. (If you do not know what CSS preprocessors are, please safely ignore it.)

                    <h3>
                     Layouts
                 </h3>
                 <p>
                    Users can view the images in two modes -- grid layout (which arranges the photos in a grid format) 
                    or list layout (which arranges the photos one after another, along with the metadata for each photo).
                    To switch between these two layout modes, users can click a button found in a toolbar that is <em>fixed</em>
                    to the top (regardless of page scrolling). The two view selection buttons should be image-based <em>toggle</em> buttons: when pressed, a
                    button should appear and remain depressed until the other button is pressed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    See the following mock-ups for an idea of what the application should look like.
                </p>
                <h4>Grid Layout</h4>
                <img src="assignment_spec_images/grid_view.png" class="img-responsive">
                <h4>List Layout</h4>
                <img src="assignment_spec_images/list_view.png" class="img-responsive">
                <hr>
                <h3>
                    Responsive Design
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Your application should also be responsive to the user's display. More specifically, it must render
                    differently on smaller displays/screens/windows than on larger displays/screens/windows (effectively,
                    this means there are two visual designs for your app, one for small sizes, one for large sizes). These differences
                    should be handled entirely by CSS designed for the two different sizes (the breakpoint is defined below).
                    When displayed on a mobile device:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>the grid layout should size to the screen,</li>
                    <li>the list layout should show the metadata below, instead of beside, each image, and</li>
                    <li>any labels you provide for metadata should appear on lines separate from the metadata itself (for example,
                        if you have a "File name:" label, it should appear on a line separate from the file name; note that
                        there are no labels in any of the wireframes provided, and they're entirely optional).</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        In no case, should a horizontal scrollbar appear (for small or large displays).
                    </p>

                    <h3>Interaction with Images</h3>
                    <p>
                        Users can rate each image by selecting the number of stars to assign to that image. They should
                        also be able to filter images with a minimum rating (e.g., 3-star) by clicking on the search filter
                        on the top right of the screen, in the toolbar. Selecting the search filter will display all of the images that
                        have that rating or lower (e.g. clicking the 3-star search filter will show images with 1, 2, or 3 stars). 
                        Note that you will need to determine whether it is useful for the user to be able to clear a rating after it 
                        is assigned to an image, and if so, how that should be done.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By default, the images should be displayed as smaller thumbnails. Clicking on an image should enlarge
                        it. However, it should never be larger than the width of the screen. You should also provide a mechanism
                        to return the image to a smaller size. You may choose the means of displaying the larger image, but
                        it should be your own code (i.e. not code taken from the web).

                        You should place all of your CSS in <a href="css/fotag.css">fotag.css</a>. There are a number of examples
                        within the provided code for creating widgets, dealing with file selections, and storing and loading
                        data. Study these carefully and adapt them to your needs.

                    <h3>Image Selection</h3>
                    <p>
                        We will be using HTML5's new File API to select multiple files
                        on the file system. This API provides a file name and modification date for each
                        file chosen.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You will use <code>img</code> tags to "load" images into the web page.
                        The File API does not provide an absolute path to the file, which is problematic, since
                        the <code>img</code> tag requires an absolute or relative path to a
                        file. Accordingly, we will assume all files that are chosen are chosen from the images/ directory.
                        Given this assumption, when a user chooses an image filename.jpg, and you wish to view it, you can construct an <code>img</code>
                        tag whose src is images/filename.jpg. We have included
                        a handful of images in that directory to facilitate testing. Please do not delete these images,
                        as they may be used in testing.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We have already provided demo code that demonstrates how to select images and place them
                        in the models specified below. When a user selects images to view, they should be saved
                        via <code>localStorage</code> using the provided code. Furthermore, when reloading the page, the app
                        should automatically load the images from <code>localStorage</code> and redisplay them.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The File API (theoretically) also allows users to drag and drop files into the browser to select them. See
                        <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/dndfiles/">http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/dndfiles/</a>
                        for example code. This functionality is not required, but would be useful.

                    <h3>Responsive Design Breakpoints</h3>
                    <p>
                        For the purposes of this assignment, a "small" device should be considered any device, display, or window
                        whose width is less than 760 pixels. Set your media query breakpoints in CSS accordingly. We will test
                        your application to ensure it is responsive when the window size or device size is smaller than 760 pixels.
                    </p>
                    <hr>
                    <h3>Models</h3>
                    <p>
                        Your implementation must make use of the model-view-controller architecture. Specifically,
                        you must implement the following models, stubbed out in <a href="js/model.js">model.js</a>:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <code>ImageModel</code>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <code>ImageCollectionModel</code>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>ImageModel</h4>
                    <p>
                        The <code>ImageModel</code> represents a single image: the path to the image, its modification date,
                        the user rating, and any user-supplied caption. The modification date, user rating, and caption all
                        represent its <em>metadata</em>. You do not need to support the ability for users
                        to caption images, though that would be a nice, and useful, feature.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The ImageModel must implement the Observer pattern, and notify listeners whenever it changes in any way.
                        The signature for listeners is specified in the code.
                    </p>

                    <h4>ImageCollectionModel</h4>
                    <p>
                        The <code>ImageCollectionModel</code> represents a collection of <code>ImageModel</code> objects. It must also
                        implement the Observer pattern and notify listeners whenever it, <strong>or any of its <code>ImageModel</code> objects</strong>,
                        changes in any way. The signature for listeners is specified in the code.

                    </p>
                    <hr>
                    <h3>Views</h3>
                    <p>
                        You must implement the following views, found in <a href="js/view.js">view.js</a>:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <code>ImageRenderer</code>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <code>ImageRendererFactory</code> (technically, not a view)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <code>ImageCollectionView</code>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <code>Toolbar</code>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        All of your views should be able to be instantiated multiple times. In other words, they should
                        be template-based and not have IDs assigned to their individual elements. You must define
                        these views using the <code>template</code> tag in the app's HTML.
                    </p>

                    <h4>ImageRenderer</h4>
                    <p>
                        The <code>ImageRenderer</code> is the object responsible for rendering a single <code>ImageModel</code> in
                        the web page (where the <code>ImageModel</code> includes both the image and its metadata). It must
                        support two modes of rendering its contents, corresponding to either
                        list or grid view.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The renderer must also be <em>responsive</em> and change its appearance according to
                        the width of the display/window it is rendering on. Primarily, this involves changing how metadata is
                        rendered to the screen as a function of the available width. At larger widths, the metadata
                        should appear to the <em>right</em> of images. For smaller screen/device widths, it should appear
                        <em>below</em> the images.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To display an image, the <code>ImageRenderer</code> should construct an <code>img</code> tag whose src points
                        to the path contained within the corresponding <code>ImageModel</code>. The <code>ImageRenderer</code> should
                        render <em>thumbnails</em> of the images, rather than the images at full size. You should determine
                        what an acceptable size is for the thumbnails through user testing.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to rendering the associated metadata, the <code>ImageRenderer</code> should also support
                        any interaction required. It should also update its view if the underlying
                        <code>ImageModel</code> changes in any way. Your view should register with the model as a listener,
                        to be informed of any changes.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The <code>ImageRenderer</code> has a method, <code>getElement()</code>, which must return
                        an element that can be added to the DOM.
                    </p>

                    <h4>ImageRendererFactory</h4>
                    <p>
                        A Factory is an object that produces other objects. In this assignment, you will create an
                        <code>ImageRendererFactory</code> that will produce new <code>ImageRenderer</code> objects.
                        The <code>ImageCollectionView</code> will use whatever <code>ImageRendererFactory</code> object
                        is installed in it to create new <code>ImageRenderer</code> objects as needed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Factory object is not complicated: it just creates new objects that fulfill the <code>ImageRenderer</code>
                        class's contract. You can think of it as an object constructor, of sorts. For example, to
                        create a new <code>ImageRendererFactory</code> that produces the <code>ImageRenderer</code> objects described above,
                        you would just need a line of code like <code>new ImageRenderer(imageModel)</code> in your code.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Factoring the design this way will allow us to substitute different <code>ImageRenderer</code>s
                        at runtime, to test your MVC architecture.
                    </p>

                    <h4>ImageCollectionView</h4>
                    <p>
                        The <code>ImageCollectionView</code> is the view for <code>ImageCollectionModel</code> objects.
                        It is also a collection of <code>ImageRenderer</code> objects.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The <code>ImageCollectionView</code> creates new <code>ImageRenderer</code> objects using
                        an <code>ImageRendererFactory</code>. By default, it should have an <code>ImageRendererFactory</code>
                        installed when it is constructed. This factory can be set at runtime, at which time, the
                        view should update to use the new factory (i.e., it should recreate the interface using the new
                        factory, whenever a new factory is installed).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        You <em>may not</em> use a <code>table</code> to implement the <code>ImageCollectionView</code>. Instead,
                        you should use floats or inline-blocks to lay out your individual <code>ImageRenderer</code> objects.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The <code>ImageCollectionView</code> provides methods to change the view type, and should also
                        respond to any changes to the underlying <code>ImageCollectionModel</code> (such as images being
                        added or removed).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The <code>ImageCollectionView</code> has a method, <code>getElement()</code>, which must return
                        an element that can be added to the DOM.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Toolbar</h4>
                    <p>
                        The <code>Toolbar</code> is a panel that has at least the following buttons:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            A list selection button
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            A grid selection button
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            A rating filter
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        The list and grid selection buttons allow the user to toggle between list and grid views. The
                        rating filter allows the user to select the minimum star rating for displaying images. For example, if the
                        user chooses three stars, then all images displayed must have a rating of three or greater.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        You can think of this Toolbar as both a model and a view. All objects interested in the
                        current view type and current filter rating should register with the Toolbar for changes to these settings.
                        That is, the Toolbar should be the definitive source for what is the currently selected view
                        and current minimum rating level.
                    </p>

                    <h4>File Selection</h4>
                    <p>
                        The designs do not specify how you should allow the user to choose what files to load and display.
                        We have included demo code that demonstrates how to get files, but it is up to you to incorporate
                        this functionality into the app's design in a way that makes for a good visual design and interactive
                        experience.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Marking Button and Unit Tests</h4>
                    <p>
                        You'll note in the HTML that we include a marking button and a link to unit tests. Neither
                        of these should be altered or removed. They will allow us to programmatically test and manipulate
                        your application for marking purposes.
                    </p>

                        <a href="js/unit_tests/marking_unit_tests.js">marking_unit_tests.js</a> and
                        <a href="js/unit_tests/student_unit_tests.js">student_unit_tests.js</a>. There is a link in
                        the web app's page to go to this unit test. This link should remain within the code, so TAs can
                        easily execute your unit tests.

                            of user experience will be part of the implementation marks.

                            TAs will mark your assignment using the latest version of Chrome on whatever platform
                            they use on a daily basis. In theory, the specific platform shouldn't matter. If we
                            find platform differences, we'll handle them as they arise. They will mark the assignment
                            in "offline" mode (i.e., with no access to the Internet).
